1. Initial Concept & Research 

1.1 Why This Project?
Exploring Audience Interaction in Generative Art
This project investigates how real-time interactivity transforms generative art, focusing on audience engagement and emergent behavior. Inspired by Golan Levin’s Audiovisual Environment Suite, I wanted to explore how user inputs (mouse movement, clicks, and microphone sound) can shape a dynamic visual system.
The use of a particle system was chosen due to its ability to simulate natural, emergent movement—where individual elements behave autonomously but form cohesive, unpredictable patterns. This aligns with Casey Reas’ concept of "art from rules", where a set of simple principles can create complex, evolving compositions. 
Additionally, the project incorporates sound-driven interactivity, responding to ambient noise and user-generated input. This adds a layer of unpredictability, reinforcing ideas from Glitch Art and Generative Systems, where randomness is an integral part of creative computing. 
By integrating these interactive elements, my goal was to create an artwork that is not just observed but actively shaped by its audience, questioning the role of human agency in generative art.

2. Technical Implementation

2.1 Setting Up the Canvas and Microphone 
This project initializes a **full-screen canvas** and a **microphone input** using `p5.AudioIn()`. The microphone is used to capture real-time volume levels, which influence the number of particles generated.  

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);

  // ✅ ChatGPT: Added microphone initialization for sound-based interaction
  mic = new p5.AudioIn();
  mic.start();
}
```

2.2 Mouse and Sound-Based Particle Generation  
Particles are dynamically generated based on user input:  

- Mouse movement: Generates particles at the mouse position.  
- Mouse click: Clicking increases the number of particles.  
- Sound input: Louder sounds generate more particles, creating a dynamic effect based on real-world audio input.  

```javascript
function draw() {
  background(0, 20); // ✅ ChatGPT: Reduced background opacity to create a fading effect

  let vol = mic.getLevel(); // ✅ ChatGPT: Retrieves microphone volume level
  let numParticles = map(vol, 0, 1, 5, 50); // ✅ ChatGPT: Maps volume level to dynamically adjust particle count

  // ✅ ChatGPT: Introduced sound-based particle generation
  for (let i = 0; i < numParticles; i++) {
    let p = new Particle(mouseX, mouseY);
    particles.push(p);
  }

  // ✅ ChatGPT: Optimized loop for memory efficiency (removes faded-out particles)
  for (let i = particles.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    particles[i].update();
    particles[i].show();

    if (particles[i].finished()) {
      particles.splice(i, 1); // ✅ ChatGPT: Prevents memory issues by removing faded particles
    }
  }
}
```

---

2.3 Mouse Click Interaction 
Clicking generates 10 extra particles at the mouse position.  

```javascript
function mousePressed() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    particles.push(new Particle(mouseX, mouseY));
  }
}
```

---

2.4 Object-Oriented Particle System 
Each particle is an instance of the `Particle` class, which manages its properties and behavior.  

Particle Class Features
- Dynamic movement: Random velocities for natural motion.  
- Opacity fade-out: Particles slowly disappear for a smoother animation.  
- Color variation: Randomized color for a vibrant effect.  

```javascript
class Particle {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.vx = random(-2, 2);
    this.vy = random(-2, 2);
    this.alpha = 255;
    this.size = random(5, 15);
    this.color = [random(255), random(255), random(255)];
  }

  update() {
    this.x += this.vx;
    this.y += this.vy;
    this.alpha -= 2; // ✅ ChatGPT: Implements fade-out effect
  }

  finished() {
    return this.alpha < 0; // ✅ ChatGPT: Removes fully faded particles
  }

  show() {
    noStroke();
    fill(this.color[0], this.color[1], this.color[2], this.alpha);
    ellipse(this.x, this.y, this.size);
  }
}
```

3. Problem-Solving & Debugging 

3.1 Initial Issues & Fixes
❌ Particles accumulating infinitely, causing performance issues  
✅ Implemented `splice(i, 1)` to remove faded particles and prevent memory leaks.  

❌ Microphone input too sensitive, generating excessive particles
✅ Mapped `mic.getLevel()` to limit the maximum number of particles dynamically.  

❌Particles moving too fast or too slow 
✅ Adjusted velocity range (`vx`, `vy`) to ensure natural motion**.
